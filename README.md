## Getting started  
[[Back to summary] [summary_link]]  
**There are a couple of ways to install PHOTON:**  
1. The easiest is to install the following css in the head of your webpage:  
  ```HTML  
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="examplepath/to/main_style.min.css">
  ```  
  And the following javascript files before the end ``</body>`` tag:  
  ```HTML  
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>  
<script>window.jQuery || document.write("<script src=\"../dist/js/lib/jquery-1.11.3.min.js\">"+"<"+"/script>")</script>  
<script src="../dist/js/main_script.min.js"></script>  
  ```  
2. If you really want to get a hold of the source code, you can [download the latest release] [photon_github] from GitHub.
3. Or clone the [Git repository] [photon_github] by running the following command:

## Overview  
[[Back to summary] [summary_link]]  
**A short description about what's it like to work with PHOTON:**
### Based on Bootstrap 3.3.5.  
[[Back to summary] [summary_link]]  
PHOTON is based on the Twitter Bootstrap architecture [GetBootstrap] [bootstrap_getstarted]. If you're not familiarized with Twitter Bootstrap, head on over to their website and check-out their stuff. It's great!  
Aside from the elements provided by bootstrap, PHOTON comes with its own set of unique components, styling and useful plugins that you can use in your project.  
The fun part about PHOTON is that you can configure it however you want. Whether if it's for speed, mobile devices, lots of features or a usability unicorn.  
**Features:**  
1. Keeping it light with an average page weight of 500Kb  
2. W3C Compliant  
3. WCAG 2.0 Compliant  
4. Average page-load time of 1s  
### Working with Grunt.js  
[[Back to summary] [summary_link]]  
**Installing Grunt:**  
To install Grunt, you must first download and install [node.js] [nodejs_download] (which includes npm). Believe it or not, npm stands for node packaged modules and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js.  
Once you've installed node.js, open up the command line in the root directory.  
Install grunt-cli globally by running ``npm install -g grunt-cli``.  
Afterwards run ``npm install`` for npm to look at the **package.json** file and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.  
When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.  

**Available Grunt commands:**
```
grunt styles            - CSS distribution task
grunt scripts           - JS distribution task
grunt plugin_styles     - Generate plugin styles
grunt plugin_scripts    - Generate plugin scripts
grunt default           - Generate main styles and scripts
```

### Working with Photon's folder structure:
